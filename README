# Simple C Unit Test Framework (SCU)

SCU is a simple C unit testing framework that integrates with _STR_, the simple test runner.

## Writing tests

TODO: document how to create unit test suites

## Compiling tests

TODO: mention that we need to compile the tests with the `-ljansson` flag

## Executing tests

TODO: document how to run the tests with STR

## Dependencies

Since the STR protocol uses JSON to relay the messages between the test suite and the test runner, we need `libjansson` to be installed. On Ubuntu you should be able to install this using the following command:

  apt install libjansson-dev
